st.subheader("Why you SHOULD raise single mothers rents")
st.text("Written by Martin Luther King Jr.")
st.markdown("Landlords across the country are raising the rents of single mothers, but what’s the benefit? Well, through trial and error landlords have found that single mothers are the perfect people to rent to, as they don’t have enough money to find a better living situation. This allows you to be able to overcharge and neglect them, with no real repercussions for the landlords. Instead of having repercussions these landlords are making millions off of these single mothers."

"Early development is one of the most important times for these young kids, it lays the fundamentals for how the rest of their lives will go. Young kids need a sense of challenge and danger to be able to properly stimulate their developing mind. This is exactly where raising the rent of single mothers comes in. When you raise the rent of a single mother it's only a matter of time before they have to become homeless, which is the perfect environment to raise children that will thrive in our modern world. While homeless, our young children will be able to learn basic self defense, fighting off crackheads, and be able to learn measurements and conversion rates. With all of these benefits the government has projected a fifty percent increase in homelessness among adolescence."

st.markdown("In a great conclusion to the Russian Ukraine war, Russia has emerged victorious. The final battle started at 3:26 am on the border between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine started out with a line of marksmen mowing down the Russian soldiers. It's believed these marksmen got well over 200 kills; futhermore, Ukraine was able to deploy multiple helicopters and UAV's during the first few minutes. However, in the final minutes the of battle, just when all hope was lost, Putin mounted his trusty horse and got to quick work on the Ukraine defense. Single-handedly putin was able to take down the whole army and hit the griddy on his horse. After this well fought battle, I believe there to be no debate that Putin is the only proper candidate for world leader.")
